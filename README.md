This application can be used as a starting point for building more complex web applications using Angular 14. The code is well-documented and follows best practices for Angular development.

This challenge is to integrate with the [REST Countries API](https://restcountries.com/#api-endpoints-v2) to pull country data and display it like in the designs. Use TypeScript and React.

### Brief

### Project Task: 
Implementing Designs from the /design folder.

In this project, you will find mobile and desktop designs for both pages. The designs are in JPG static format. This will mean that you'll need to use your best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`. This should help train your eye to perceive differences in spacings and sizes. Feel free to use any component libraries you may need.

There are no assets for this challenge, as the country flags will be pulled from the [REST Countries API](https://restcountries.com/#api-endpoints-v2) and you can use an icon font library for the icons.
